The newlywed couple move into Takashi’s family home (shared with his sister, father and grandfather), but Sakura’s nymphomaniac sex drive soon starts to cause tensions.  When Takashi starts to falter in his marital duties, Sakura turns to the rest of the family in order to satisfy her nympho lust….

Brian is witness to the Sermon of the Mount, but his seat is in such a bad location that he can't hear any of it. Ultimately he is brought before Pontius Pilate and sentenced to crucifixion, which takes place at that crowded, non-exclusive execution site a few blocks shy of Calvary. Rather than utter the Last Six Words, Brian leads his fellow crucifixees in a spirited rendition of a British music hall cheer-up song 'Always Look on the Bright Side of Life'.",
