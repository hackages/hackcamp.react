/*
Create store allows you to create a store containing your reducers, an initialState and some middleware
This store will hold the complete state tree of your app.
There should only be a single store in your app.

All the information you need to make the store work can be found here
 http://redux.js.org/docs/api/createStore.html

In order to use the devtools, please follow this guide.
